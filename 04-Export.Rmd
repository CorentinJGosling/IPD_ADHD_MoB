Once you have run the script and the calculations are finished (you will know that the analyses are completed when the red stop flag in the top right of the R console disappears), the last message in the console should be the location in which the file has been generated. This message is under the form :

"[1] "C:/Users/your-name/Desktop/ADHD_StudyX_res.RData"

Last, send us this file at corentin.gosling@parisnanterre.fr. This output did not include any individual data, only summaries.<br>
The results will be analyzed as soon as possible. When we will have finished to analyze your results, we will get back to you with the main conclusions that can be drawn from your study.

Thank you very much for your help!
