# Forword{-}

We would like to thank you warmly for your collaboration with our research team. 

This document details how to carry out the data analysis described in Gosling, Pinabiaux, Caparos, Delorme & Cortese (2020) <https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/10/11/e040952.full.pdf>. 

As you will see, we will explain here:

  + how to install R and R studio
  + how to format your dataset
  + how to run the R script which will automatically perform all the required analyses 
  + how to share the results of the analyses with us
  
If you have any question, you can ask them directly to corentin.gosling@parisnanterre.fr. We can also schedule a visioconference to assist you in performing the analysis. All the process (from downloading R to obtaining the results) usually takes no more than one hour.
